 Query: # Problem Statement

Solve a 9×9 grid that satisfies both Sudoku rules and Minesweeper-like constraints. The grid contains standard Sudoku clues (pre-filled numbers) and "mine-count clues" where specific cells must count neighboring mines.

## Instance Data

### Sudoku Clues (Pre-filled Cells)

The following cells are fixed and cannot be changed:
```
5 _ _ | _ 7 _ | _ _ 2
_ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
_ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
------+-------+------
4 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
_ _ _ | _ 5 _ | _ _ 1
_ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
------+-------+------
_ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
_ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
3 _ _ | _ 8 _ | _ _ 9
```

Coordinates (0-indexed):
- (0,0): 5, (0,4): 7, (0,8): 2
- (4,0): 4, (4,4): 5, (4,8): 1
- (8,0): 3, (8,4): 8, (8,8): 9

### Mine-Count Clue Locations

The following cells must contain values equal to their count of neighboring mines:
- (0,1)
- (3,1)
- (5,7)

A cell is a **mine** if it contains an **even digit** (2, 4, 6, or 8).

## Constraints

1. **Standard Sudoku rules**: Each row, column, and 3×3 box must contain digits 1-9 **exactly** once
2. **Sudoku clues (hints)**: The 9 pre-filled cells are provided as hints. **If they conflict with mine-count constraints, the mine-count constraints take priority** and clue values may need to change
3. **Mine definition**: A cell is a mine if and only if its value is **even**
4. **Mine-count clues**: Each mine-count clue cell's value **must equal** the number of its 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) that are mines

**Constraint Priority:** Mine-count clues (Constraint 4) have highest priority. If satisfying them requires changing initial Sudoku clues, those changes are allowed.

## Objective

Find a complete 9×9 grid satisfying all Sudoku and Minesweeper constraints.

## Output Format

  ],

  "is_valid_sudoku": true,
  "sudoku_clues_preserved": true,
  "mine_clues_satisfied": true
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `grid`: 9×9 array of integers (1-9), the complete solution
- `mines`: Array of [row, col] coordinates for all cells containing even numbers
- `is_valid_sudoku`: Boolean, true if grid satisfies all Sudoku rules
- `sudoku_clues_preserved`: Boolean, true if all 9 pre-filled cells remain unchanged (false if mine-count constraints required changes)
- `mine_clues_satisfied`: Boolean, true if all 3 mine-count clues are correct (highest priority)

### Thinking

- **Defining the Sudoku Grid**
- I've established the foundation: a standard 9x9 Sudoku grid adhering to the usual rules. I've also solidified my mine definition, deeming even digits as mines and odd digits as safe. I'm now at the stage of defining mine-count clues.
- **Formulating the Constraints**
- I'm now integrating mine-count logic.  Each cell's mine count is determined by its adjacent cells, a crucial constraint. I've detailed how mine-count clues will interact with Sudoku clues; the mine-count ones have precedence. This includes the initial placements such as (0,0)=5, (0,4)=7, (0,8)=2, etc. These define initial configurations with 5 mines surrounding (0,0). I'm strategizing how to reconcile these overlapping rules, prioritizing mine counts.
- **Validating the Solution**
- I'm now generating a valid Sudoku solution to see how it works with the mine-count rules. This is important: the problem states these must take priority. I'm moving toward a standard approach, checking the Sudoku's validity. If it works, I will integrate mine-count clues from the start, prioritizing them during the grid's construction.
- **Verifying the Solution**
- I've tested rows and columns for sums of 45, confirming standard Sudoku rules. Now, I'm validating a completed grid to ensure no repetitions exist within each row, column, and 3x3 block. This step confirms the core Sudoku constraints are intact before mine-count logic is applied.
- **Analyzing the Clues**
- I'm now diving into the mine-count clues, using the established mine definition (evens are mines). I'm looking at the provided grid to cross-check each cell's mine count. I'll need to examine all neighbors of each cell and ensure the counts are correctly represented.
- **Calculating Mine Counts**
- I'm now calculating mine counts, using even numbers as mines, and have refined the listing of mine locations. I'm focusing on validating the mine-count clue at (0,1).  I'm moving forward with a detailed cross-check of each cell's neighborhood. I'm making sure these counts align with the defined mine configuration.
