 Query: # Problem Statement

Assign radio frequencies to transmitters while respecting band restrictions, managing interference constraints, and minimizing total licensing costs.

## Instance Data

**Transmitters:** t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10

**Frequencies with Bands and Costs:**
- Low band: 101 (cost 10), 102 (cost 12), 103 (cost 15)
- Mid band: 201 (cost 20), 202 (cost 22), 203 (cost 25), 204 (cost 28)
- High band: 301 (cost 40), 302 (cost 45)

**Transmitter Band Restrictions:**
- Low band only: t1, t2
- Mid band only: t3, t4, t5
- High band only: t6
- Low or mid bands: t7, t8
- Mid or high bands: t9, t10

**Interference Pairs:**
(t1, t2), (t1, t7), (t2, t8), (t3, t4), (t3, t9), (t4, t5), (t4, t7), (t5, t8), (t5, t10), (t6, t9), (t6, t10)

## Constraints

1. **Band Restriction:** Each transmitter can only be assigned a frequency from its allowed band(s).

2. **Same-Band Interference:** If two interfering transmitters use frequencies from the **same band**, their frequencies must differ by more than 1 (e.g., 101 and 103 are valid, but 101 and 102 are not).

3. **Cross-Band Interference:** If two interfering transmitters use frequencies from **different bands**, they cannot use the same frequency number (even though frequencies like 201 and 301 exist, conceptually they cannot conflict).

4. **Complete Assignment:** Every transmitter must be assigned exactly one frequency.

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes** the total licensing cost (sum of costs of all assigned frequencies).

**Expected minimum cost: 200**

## Output Format

The solution must be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "assignments": [
    {"transmitter": "t1", "frequency": 103},
    {"transmitter": "t2", "frequency": 101},
    {"transmitter": "t3", "frequency": 203},
    {"transmitter": "t4", "frequency": 201},
    {"transmitter": "t5", "frequency": 203},
    {"transmitter": "t6", "frequency": 301},
    {"transmitter": "t7", "frequency": 101},
    {"transmitter": "t8", "frequency": 103},
    {"transmitter": "t9", "frequency": 201},
    {"transmitter": "t10", "frequency": 201}
  ],
  "total_cost": 200
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- `assignments`: Array of assignment objects, each containing:
  - `transmitter`: String identifier (e.g., "t1")
  - `frequency`: Integer frequency value (e.g., 101, 201, 301)
- `total_cost`: Integer representing the sum of all assigned frequency costs


Return your final answer in JSON format.


### Thinking

- **Analyzing Initial Metrics**
- I've begun examining the initial data, specifically the "Low" and "Mid" values across different sets. It appears that t1 and t2 share identical values, but t3, t4, and t5 present similar figures in their groups. I'm focusing on identifying any patterns or discrepancies within these early sets.
- **Exploring Band Restrictions**
- I'm now delving into the band restrictions, specifically the "same-band" and "cross-band" interference rules. The initial wording is leading to ambiguity, and I'm re-reading it to clarify the contradictory statements regarding frequency number usage across different bands, attempting to reconcile the conceptual constraints.
- **Clarifying Cross-Band Rules**
- I am still wrestling with the cross-band interference rule, repeatedly re-reading it. The conflicting wording is making it hard to interpret, so I'm trying to deduce if frequencies from different bands can indeed share the same number. Despite the example seeming contradictory, I'm now exploring the underlying intention.
- **Interpreting Frequency Rules**
- I am now tackling the core ambiguity around cross-band frequency usage and have re-read the relevant constraints. It's still unclear, so I'm trying to deduce the intended meaning, which seems to imply that frequencies in different bands *can* use the same number. I'm exploring the implications of this interpretation to resolve the conflict in the wording.
