 Query: # Problem Statement

Solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle SEND + MORE = MONEY where each letter represents a unique digit.

## Instance Data

The puzzle is: **SEND + MORE = MONEY**

Letters involved: S, E, N, D, M, O, R, Y (8 unique letters)

Each letter must be assigned a digit from 0-9, and all letters must have different digits.

## Constraints

1. **Unique Digits:** Each of the 8 unique letters (S, E, N, D, M, O, R, Y) must be assigned a different digit from 0-9.
2. **Leading Zeros:** The leading letters of the numbers (S and M) cannot be assigned the digit 0.
3. **Arithmetic Correctness:** The assignment of digits to letters must satisfy the following columnar addition:
   ```
     S E N D
   + M O R E
   ---------
   = M O N E Y
   ```

## Objective

Find the unique assignment of digits to letters that satisfies all constraints.

## Output Format

```json
{
  "assignment": {
    "S": <digit>,
    "E": <digit>,
    "N": <digit>,
    "D": <digit>,
    "M": <digit>,
    "O": <digit>,
    "R": <digit>,
    "Y": <digit>
  },
  "equation": "SEND + MORE = MONEY becomes <numeric_equation>",
  "valid": true
}
```

**Field Descriptions:**
- `assignment`: Dictionary mapping each letter to its assigned digit (0-9)
- `equation`: String showing the substituted numeric equation (e.g., "9567 + 1085 = 10652")
- `valid`: Boolean indicating if the solution satisfies all constraints


Return your final answer in JSON format.


### Thinking

- **Analyzing the Letter Puzzle**
- I've made progress on the letter puzzle. I've established the unique digit constraint for the letters, and also that neither S nor M can be zero. I've also re-iterated the column addition structure for clarity. Now I am focused on the implications of the leftmost column, and how to deduce M.
- **Deducing the Value of M**
- I've determined that M must be 1, because the maximum sum of two four-digit numbers is less than 20000.  The column structure helps here, so that means S+1+c3 = 10 + O. Using this, I've narrowed down the possibilities to two cases for S and O, specifically that they can be either (S,O) = (9,0) with c3 = 0, or (S,O) = (8,0) with c3 = 1.


```json
{
  "assignment": {
    "S": 9,
    "E": 5,
    "N": 6,
    "D": 7,
    "M": 1,
    "O": 0,
    "R": 8,
    "Y": 2
  },
  "equation": "SEND + MORE = MONEY becomes 9567 + 1085 = 10652",
  "valid": true
}
