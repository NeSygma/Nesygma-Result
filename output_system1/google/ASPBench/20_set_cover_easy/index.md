 Query: # Problem Statement

Given a universe of elements and a collection of sets, find the minimum number of sets needed to cover all elements in the universe.

## Instance Data

**Universe:** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

**Available Sets:**
- Set 0: {1, 2, 3}
- Set 1: {2, 4, 5}
- Set 2: {3, 6, 7}
- Set 3: {1, 4, 8}
- Set 4: {5, 6, 7, 8}
- Set 5: {1, 2, 6}

## Constraints

1. **All** elements in the universe {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} **must** be covered
2. Each element **must** be covered by **at least one** selected set
3. **No** duplicate sets can be selected

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes** the number of selected sets.

**Expected optimal value:** 3 sets

## Output Format

```json
{
  "selected_sets": [0, 1, ...],
  "total_sets": 3,
  "covered_elements": [1, 2, ...]
}
```

**Field descriptions:**
- `selected_sets`: Array of set indices that were selected (from 0-5)
- `total_sets`: Total number of sets selected (must equal length of selected_sets)
- `covered_elements`: Array of all covered elements (must be [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])


Return your final answer in JSON format.


### Thinking

- **Defining the Universe**
- I've established the universal set as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} and defined several subsets: Set 0, Set 1, Set 2, Set 3, Set 4, and Set 5. My current objective is to figure something out, using these components.
- **Determining Set Coverage**
- I'm now zeroing in on the minimum sets required to cover the universal set. I've ruled out the possibility of using only two sets. Exploring combinations of three sets is underway, starting with Set 4. I've analyzed potential set combinations to cover the remaining elements, and am now testing a combination, with the goal of minimizing the number of sets.


```json
{
  "selected_sets": [0, 1, 4],
  "total_sets": 3,
  "covered_elements": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
}
```

### TOKEN USAGE
