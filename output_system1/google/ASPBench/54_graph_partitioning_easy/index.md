 Query: # Problem Statement

Partition 8 vertices into two equal-sized sets (4 vertices each) such that the number of edges crossing between partitions is minimized. This is a balanced graph partitioning problem.

## Instance Data

**Vertices:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (8 vertices total)

**Edges:**
- (0,1), (0,4)
- (1,2), (1,5)
- (2,3), (2,6)
- (3,7)
- (4,5), (4,6)
- (5,7)
- (6,7)

## Constraints

1. **Exactly** 4 vertices in partition 1
2. **Exactly** 4 vertices in partition 2
3. **All** vertices must be assigned to exactly one partition
4. **No** vertex can appear in both partitions

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes** the number of edges crossing between the two partitions (cut size).

**Expected optimal cut size: 3**

## Output Format

```json
{
  "partition_1": [0, 1, ...],
  "partition_2": [2, 3, ...],
  "cut_size": 3,
  "cut_edges": [
    {"from": 1, "to": 2},
    ...
  ],
  "balance": {
    "partition_1_size": 4,
    "partition_2_size": 4,
    "is_balanced": true
  }
}
```

- `partition_1`: List of vertex IDs in first partition (4 vertices)
- `partition_2`: List of vertex IDs in second partition (4 vertices)
- `cut_size`: Number of edges crossing between partitions
- `cut_edges`: List of edges crossing partitions, each with `from` and `to` fields (from < to)
- `balance`: Object with partition sizes and balance status


Return your final answer in JSON format.


### Thinking

- **Defining the Graph Structure**
- I have formalized the graph's structure. The vertex set comprises eight elements: 0 through 7. I've meticulously defined the edges, specifying connections between these vertices. There are eleven edges in total. The structural details are now set for further analysis.
- **Analyzing Partitioning Strategies**
- I am now focusing on partitioning the graph's vertices into two groups of four. I'm aiming for a cut size of just three edges. I've visualized the graph and defined the edge connections. I'm testing a {0, 1, 4, 5} and {2, 3, 6, 7} split to confirm a cut size of 3 and have confirmed a 3-edge cut.


```json
{
  "partition_1": [0, 1, 4, 5],
  "partition_2": [2, 3, 6, 7],
  "cut_size": 3,
  "cut_edges": [
    {"from": 1, "to": 2},
    {"from": 4, "to": 6},
    {"from": 5, "to": 7}
  ],
  "balance": {
    "partition_1_size": 4,
    "partition_2_size": 4,
    "is_balanced": true
  }
}
```
