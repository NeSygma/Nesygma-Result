 Query: # Problem Statement

Determine the winning bids in a combinatorial auction that maximizes total revenue. Bidders submit bids for bundles of items, and each item can be allocated to at most one bidder.

## Instance Data

**Bidders:** A, B, C, D

**Items:** item1, item2, item3, item4, item5

**Bids submitted:**
- Bidder A: {item1, item2} for $100
- Bidder A: {item3} for $50
- Bidder B: {item2, item3} for $120
- Bidder B: {item4, item5} for $80
- Bidder C: {item1, item3, item5} for $150
- Bidder D: {item4} for $40

## Constraints

1. **No conflicts:** Each item may be allocated to **at most one** bidder
2. **Valid bids:** Only submitted bids can win
3. **Bundle integrity:** Winning bids **must** include **all** items in the bundle

## Objective

Find a solution that **maximizes** total revenue from accepted bids.

**Expected optimal revenue:** 230

## Output Format

```json
{
  "winning_bids": [
    {"bidder": "A", "items": ["item1", "item2"], "price": 100},
    ...
  ],
  "total_revenue": 230,
  "item_allocation": {
    "item1": "A",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Field descriptions:**
- `winning_bids`: List of accepted bid objects (bidder, items, price)
- `total_revenue`: Sum of prices from winning bids
- `item_allocation`: Map from item to winning bidder (or null if unallocated)


Return your final answer in JSON format.


### Thinking

- **Analyzing Initial Bids**
- I've started mapping the initial bid landscape. I've got bidders A, B, C, and D, eyeing items 1 through 5. Bidder A has two bids, A1 and A2, for specific item combinations and prices. B is similarly positioned. I will continue to process the information, to determine an optimal bidding outcome.
- **Evaluating Bid Set Combinations**
- I've been exploring different combinations now, and I've found that B1 and B2 together provide a revenue of 200. This is the best so far. This leaves item 1 unused. I'm now comparing this result against scenarios where C1 wins, to see if there are better outcomes.
- **Calculating Revenue Potential**
- I've just run a few revenue scenarios. I have a combination of bids yielding $160 from items 2, 3, and 4. Another using A1, B2, and A2 gives $230, using all the items! I've also found an approach that uses A1, D1, and A2 which results in $190. Still exploring other bids, but it's looking promising.

    "item4": "B",
    "item5": "B"
  }
}
