 Query: # Problem Statement

Find all minimum-cost Hamiltonian paths from a specified start vertex to a specified end vertex in a directed, weighted graph. A Hamiltonian path visits each vertex exactly once. The total path cost is the sum of the weights of the edges used. Some edges are present in the graph but are forbidden and must not be used.

## Instance Data

**Graph:** 100 vertices (0 to 99)
**Start vertex:** 0
**End vertex:** 99

**Edges with weights:**

1. Chain edges (weight 1): For all i in 0..98: edge (i, i+1) with weight 1

2. Local swap gadgets every 4 vertices starting at 2 (weight 3):
   - For N in 0..23, let B = 2 + 4*N:
     - Edge (B, B+2) with weight 3
     - Edge (B+2, B+1) with weight 3
     - Edge (B+1, B+3) with weight 3

3. Skips of length 2 at multiples of 4 (weight 4):
   - For N in 0..24, let S = 4*N with S+2 <= 99:
     - Edge (S, S+2) with weight 4

4. Jumps of length 3 for vertices ≡ 1 (mod 4) (weight 5):
   - For N in 0..23, let T = 1 + 4*N:
     - Edge (T, T+3) with weight 5

5. Long bridges of length 4 at multiples of 5 (weight 6):
   - For K in 0..19, let U = 5*K:
     - Edge (U, U+4) with weight 6

**Forbidden edges** (these edges exist in the graph but cannot be used):

1. Base forbids: (0,2), (1,3)

2. Periodic forbids:
   - For N in 0..11, F = 2 + 8*N: forbid (F, F+2)
   - For N in 0..12, G = 8*N with G+2 <= 99: forbid (G, G+2)
   - For N in 0..11, H = 1 + 8*N: forbid (H, H+3)
   - For M in 0..9, L = 10*M + 5 with L+4 <= 99: forbid (L, L+4)

## Constraints

1. Each vertex 0..99 appears **exactly once** in each path
2. Path starts at vertex **0** and ends at vertex **99**
3. Path follows **directed edges** in the graph
4. **Forbidden edges** must not be used
5. Total cost is the sum of **weights** of chosen edges

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes** the total cost.

**Expected optimal cost: 99**

## Output Format

Output **exactly** this JSON structure (no extra text):

```json
{
  "paths": [[vertex_0, vertex_1, ..., vertex_99], ...],
  "count": number_of_optimal_paths,
  "exists": true_or_false,
  "min_cost": minimal_cost_value
}
```

**Field descriptions:**
- `paths`: List of all minimum-cost Hamiltonian paths (each path is a list of 100 vertices from 0 to 99)
- `count`: Number of optimal paths found
- `exists`: Boolean indicating if at least one Hamiltonian path exists
- `min_cost`: The minimal total cost (sum of edge weights)

**Example output:**
```json
{"paths":[[0,1,2,3,...,98,99]],"count":1,"exists":true,"min_cost":99}
```


Return your final answer in JSON format.
