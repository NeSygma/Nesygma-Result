 Query: # Problem Statement

A Boolean gene regulatory network models how genes regulate each other through activation and inhibition relationships. Each gene can be in one of two states: active (1) or inactive (0). Find all steady states (fixed points) where applying the regulatory rules produces the same state.

## Instance Data

**Genes:** g1, g2, g3, g4, g5

**Regulatory Rules:**
- g1 is active IF AND ONLY IF g2 is not active
- g2 is active IF AND ONLY IF g1 is not active
- g3 is active IF AND ONLY IF (g4 is active AND g5 is active)
- g4 is active ALWAYS (constitutive expression)
- g5 is active ALWAYS (constitutive expression)

## Constraints

1. Each gene state must be **exactly** 0 or 1
2. **All** regulatory rules must be satisfied simultaneously
3. A state is steady if applying the rules produces the **same** state
4. **No** duplicate steady states in the output

## Objective

Find **all** steady states of the gene regulatory network.

## Output Format

```json
{
  "steady_states": [
    {"g1": 1, "g2": 0, "g3": 1, "g4": 1, "g5": 1},
    ...
  ]
}
```

- `steady_states`: List of all steady states (dictionaries with gene names as keys, states 0/1 as values)


Return your final answer in JSON format.

```json
{
  "steady_states": [
    {"g1": 0, "g2": 1, "g3": 1, "g4": 1, "g5": 1},
    {"g1": 1, "g2": 0, "g3": 1, "g4": 1, "g5": 1}
  ]
}
