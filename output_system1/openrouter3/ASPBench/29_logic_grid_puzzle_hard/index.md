 Query: # Problem Statement

Determine the complete assignment of attributes for 5 people in a logic grid puzzle. Each person has a unique location, hobby, snack, and project codename. Find any valid assignment that satisfies all the given clues.

**Compatibility Scores** (hobby-snack pairs):
- (Painting, Apple): 3
- (Coding, Muffin): 5
- (Gardening, Nuts): 2
- (Baking, Yogurt): 4
- (Sculpting, Tea): 1

## Constraints

1. The person who enjoys **Coding** is in a location **alphabetically before** the person who enjoys **Gardening**.

10. The **alphabetical distance** between the project of the person eating **Muffins** and the project of the person enjoying **Sculpting** is exactly **2** (e.g., A and C, or B and D).
11. The **sum of compatibility scores** for all five hobby-snack assignments must be exactly **15**.
