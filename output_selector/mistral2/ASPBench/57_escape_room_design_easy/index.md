 Query: # Problem Statement

Design an escape room with 6 puzzles and dependencies between them. Puzzles have difficulty levels and must be arranged so players can progress logically while maintaining engagement through balanced difficulty progression.

## Instance Data

**Puzzles:**
- Puzzle 1: difficulty 1 (easy), no prerequisites
- Puzzle 2: difficulty 1 (easy), needs puzzle 1
- Puzzle 3: difficulty 2 (medium), needs puzzles 2 and 4
- Puzzle 4: difficulty 2 (medium), needs puzzle 1
- Puzzle 5: difficulty 3 (hard), needs puzzle 3
- Puzzle 6: difficulty 3 (hard), needs puzzle 5

**Difficulty Levels:** 1 (easy), 2 (medium), 3 (hard)

## Constraints

1. **All** dependencies must be satisfied in the puzzle ordering
2. Each puzzle **must** appear exactly once in the sequence
3. A puzzle **cannot** be completed before all its prerequisites are completed
4. The sequence **must** form a valid topological ordering of the dependency graph
5. **No** circular dependencies are allowed

## Objective

Find a valid ordering of the 6 puzzles that satisfies all dependency constraints and allows logical progression through the escape room.

- `puzzle_order`: Array of puzzle IDs in the order they should be completed
- `difficulty_progression`: Array of difficulty levels corresponding to the puzzle order
- `dependencies_satisfied`: Boolean indicating if all dependencies are satisfied
- `puzzle_details`: Array of objects, one per puzzle, containing:
  - `puzzle_id`: Integer puzzle identifier (1-6)
  - `difficulty`: Integer difficulty level (1-3)
  - `prerequisites`: Array of puzzle IDs that must be completed first
