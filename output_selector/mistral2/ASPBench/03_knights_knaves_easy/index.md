 Query: # Problem Statement

You are on an island inhabited by knights (who always tell the truth) and knaves (who always lie). Three inhabitants—Alice, Bob, and Charlie—each make one statement, and you must determine who is a knight and who is a knave.

## Instance Data

**People:** Alice, Bob, Charlie

**Statements:**
- Alice says: "Bob is a knave"
- Bob says: "Alice and Charlie are of the same type"
- Charlie says: "Alice is a knight"

## Constraints

1. Each person is **exactly one** type: knight or knave
2. Knights **always tell the truth** - their statements must be true
3. Knaves **always lie** - their statements must be false
4. The assignment must be **logically consistent** with all three statements

## Objective

Find the unique assignment of types to Alice, Bob, and Charlie that satisfies all logical constraints.

**Field descriptions:**
- `alice`: Type assignment for Alice (string: "knight" or "knave")
- `bob`: Type assignment for Bob (string: "knight" or "knave")
- `charlie`: Type assignment for Charlie (string: "knight" or "knave")
