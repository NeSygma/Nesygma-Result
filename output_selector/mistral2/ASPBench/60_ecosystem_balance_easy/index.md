 Query: # Problem Statement

Model a simple ecosystem to find stable population levels that maintain predator-prey relationships and resource constraints. The ecosystem consists of 4 species with defined feeding relationships and population limits.

## Instance Data

**Species and Carrying Capacities:**
- Grass: 100 (primary producer)
- Rabbits: 30 (herbivore)
- Foxes: 10 (carnivore)
- Hawks: 5 (apex predator)

**Feeding Relationships:**
- Rabbits eat Grass
- Foxes eat Rabbits
- Hawks eat Rabbits and Foxes

## Constraints

1. **All species must have non-negative populations**
2. **Populations cannot exceed carrying capacity** for each species
3. **Herbivore populations must be sustainable** relative to primary producers (Rabbits ≤ 0.5 × Grass)
4. **Predator populations must be sustainable** relative to prey (Foxes ≤ 0.3 × Rabbits)
5. **No species can go extinct** (all populations > 0)
6. **Food web relationships must be maintained** with consumption rates between 0.1 and 0.5

## Objective

Find stable population levels that satisfy **all** ecological balance constraints while maintaining ecosystem sustainability.

**Field Descriptions:**
- `stable_populations`: Population level for each species
- `food_web`: List of predator-prey relationships with consumption rates
- `ecosystem_health.biodiversity_index`: Measure of species diversity (0-1)
- `ecosystem_health.stability_score`: Measure of ecosystem stability (0-1)
- `ecosystem_health.sustainability`: Whether the ecosystem is sustainable
- `balance_achieved`: Whether ecological balance is achieved
