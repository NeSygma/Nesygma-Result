 Query: # Problem Statement

A coalition of dissatisfied voters attempts to manipulate a plurality election by voting strategically to elect the Condorcet winner instead of the current plurality winner. The coalition members must coordinate their votes without making any member worse off.

## Instance Data

**Voters:** 6 voters (V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6)

**Candidates:** 4 candidates (A, B, C, D)

**Voter Preferences (complete rankings):**
- V1: A > B > C > D
- V2: A > C > B > D
- V3: A > D > B > C
- V4: B > C > D > A
- V5: B > A > D > C (dissatisfied)
- V6: B > D > A > C (dissatisfied)

**Initial Votes (not necessarily first preferences):**
- V1: A (first preference)
- V2: B (strategic vote, prefers A)
- V3: B (strategic vote, prefers A)
- V4: B (first preference)
- V5: A (strategic vote, prefers B)
- V6: A (strategic vote, prefers B)

**Vote Counts:**
- Original election: A=3 votes (V1, V5, V6), B=3 votes (V2, V3, V4), C=0, D=0
- Result: A wins by alphabetical tie-break (A comes before B)

**Known Facts:**
- Dissatisfied voters: V5, V6 (prefer B but currently vote A)
- Current plurality winner: A (wins 3-3 tie-break)
- Condorcet winner: B (wins all pairwise comparisons)

## Constraints

1. **Coalition Formation:** The coalition consists of dissatisfied voters who strategically change their votes
2. **Strategic Voting Rule:** Coalition members vote for the Condorcet winner (B)
3. **Manipulation Success:** The manipulated election must elect the Condorcet winner instead of the original winner
4. **Individual Rationality:** No coalition member can be made worse off by the manipulation
5. **Vote Conservation:** Total number of votes must remain constant

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes** the coalition size while achieving successful manipulation.

**Expected minimum coalition size:** 1

### Field Descriptions

- **coalition:** Object containing coalition members (array of voter IDs), size (integer), and manipulation_type (string)
- **strategic_votes:** Object mapping coalition member IDs to their strategic vote (candidate)
- **original_election:** Object with winner (candidate), vote_counts (object mapping candidates to integers), and condorcet_winner (candidate)
- **manipulated_election:** Object with winner (candidate), vote_counts (object mapping candidates to integers), and condorcet_winner (candidate)
- **manipulation_successful:** Boolean indicating if manipulation changed the winner
- **analysis:** Object with coalition_improved, no_member_worse_off, and condorcet_winner_elected (all booleans)
