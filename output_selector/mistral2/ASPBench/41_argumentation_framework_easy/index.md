 Query: # Problem Statement

An abstract argumentation framework consists of arguments and attack relations between them. Find all stable extensions, where each extension is a set of arguments that is conflict-free, self-defending, and attacks all arguments outside it.

## Instance Data

**Arguments:** a, b, c, d, e, f

**Attack Relations:**
- a attacks b
- b attacks c
- c attacks d
- d attacks e
- e attacks f
- f attacks a
- b attacks f
- d attacks b

## Constraints

1. **Conflict-free**: No argument in the extension may attack another argument in the same extension
2. **Self-defending**: For every argument in the extension, all its attackers must be attacked by some argument in the extension
3. **Maximality**: Every argument not in the extension must be attacked by some argument in the extension

## Objective

Find **all** stable extensions that satisfy the three conditions above.

Where:
- `stable_extensions`: List of all stable extensions, each extension is a list of argument names
