 Query: # Problem Statement

Fill a 24×24 grid with colors from the palette {0=white, 1=red, 2=green, 3=blue} such that each row satisfies its colored run clues in left-to-right order, each column satisfies its colored run clues in top-to-bottom order, the main diagonal matches an exact sequence, and the anti-diagonal matches an exact sequence.

**Main diagonal** (grid[i][i] for i=0..23):
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Anti-diagonal** (grid[i][23-i] for i=0..23):
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

## Constraints

1. Each **row** must satisfy its colored run clues in left-to-right order. A run clue `(color, length)` means **exactly** `length` consecutive cells of that color - no more, no less.
2. Each **column** must satisfy its colored run clues in top-to-bottom order. A run clue `(color, length)` means **exactly** `length` consecutive cells of that color - no more, no less.
3. The **main diagonal** (grid[i][i] for i=0..23) must match the exact sequence specified above
4. The **anti-diagonal** (grid[i][23-i] for i=0..23) must match the exact sequence specified above
5. **White cells (0)** are ignored when determining runs; runs of the same color must be separated by at least one cell of a different color (or white)
6. **Grid cells** must contain values from {0, 1, 2, 3}
7. **Exhaustiveness of clues**: The clues for each row or column are a complete and exhaustive list of all colored runs. Any cell not belonging to one of the specified runs **must be white (color 0)**. No additional colored cells are allowed beyond those defined by the clues.

**Example for an 8-cell row with clue [(1,3), (2,2)]:**
- ✅ Valid: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0]` - contains exactly the specified runs, all other cells white
- ❌ Invalid: `[1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]` - contains an extra unclued run of color 3
- ❌ Invalid: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0]` - first run has length 4 instead of exactly 3

## Objective

Find any valid solution that satisfies all row clues, column clues, main diagonal constraints, and anti-diagonal constraints.

### Field Descriptions

- **grid**: A 24×24 array where each element is an integer in {0, 1, 2, 3} representing the color at that cell (0-indexed)
- **valid**: Boolean indicating if the solution is valid
- **palette**: Mapping from color codes to color names

This is a **nonogram-like grid coloring problem** with exact run-length constraints, fixed diagonals, and a discrete 4-color palette.  

The problem involves:  
- Assigning one of 4 colors to each of 576 cells.  
- Satisfying exact run-length sequences for each row and column.  
- Matching two fixed diagonal sequences exactly.  
- Strict separation rules between runs of the same color.  

This is a **constraint satisfaction problem** over a finite discrete domain with strong positional and cardinality constraints. There is no need for quantifier reasoning, theorem proving, or recursive path finding.  

**Z3** is the best fit because it handles integer variables, arithmetic constraints, and complex conditional rules (like run-length encoding) efficiently.  

**Clingo** could work but would struggle with grounding 576 variables and the complex run constraints.  

**VAMPIRE** is unsuitable because this is not a first-order logic entailment problem.
