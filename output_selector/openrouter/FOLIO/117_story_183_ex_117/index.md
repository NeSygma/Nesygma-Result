 Query: Premises:
If a man is taller than another man, the taller one can block the other's shooting.
Michael is a man who is taller than everyone else in his class.
If person x is taller than person y, and person y is taller than person z, then x is taller than z
Peter is a man who is taller than Michael.
Michael can block any shooting from a person as long as the person does not jump when shooting.
Michael cannot block Windy's shooting.
Every shooter who can jump when shooting is a great shooter.

Conclusion:
Peter can block Windy's shooting.

Is the conclusion True, False, or Uncertain?


### Thinking

- We need to decide which solver is most suitable for this problem. The problem is a logical entailment question: given premises, determine if conclusion is true, false, or uncertain. This is typical first-order logic with universal statements, transitive property, etc. No numeric counting, no combinatorial search. So VAMPIRE (first-order theorem prover) is best. CLINGO is for combinatorial search, not needed. Z3 could encode but not ideal. So ranking: VAMPIRE most suitable, then Z3 maybe, then CLINGO least. Provide JSON.
