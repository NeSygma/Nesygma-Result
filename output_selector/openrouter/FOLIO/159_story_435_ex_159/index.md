 Query: Premises:
None of the students who currently work in the library are from the computer science department. 
All of the students with part-time jobs offered by the university currently work in the library. 
All of the students who are taking the database course are from the computer science department. 
All of the students taking a class with Professor David are taking the database course. 
All students working in the lab are taking a class with Professor David.
James is a student working in the lab. 
James doesn't work in the lab or have a part-time job offered by the university.

Conclusion:
James either takes the database course or has a part-time job offered by the university.

Is the conclusion True, False, or Uncertain?


### Thinking

- We need to decide which solver is most suitable for this problem. The problem is a logical entailment question: given premises, determine if conclusion is true, false, or uncertain. This is classic first-order logic with quantifiers, categories, and individuals. No numeric counting, no combinatorial search. So VAMPIRE (first-order theorem prover) is best. CLINGO is for combinatorial search, not needed. Z3 could encode but it's not natural; but VAMPIRE is best. So ranking: VAMPIRE most suitable, then maybe Z3 second (could encode as SAT), then CLINGO least. Provide JSON.
