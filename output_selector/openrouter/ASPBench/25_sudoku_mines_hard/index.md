 Query: # Problem Statement

Solve a 9×9 grid that satisfies both Sudoku rules and Minesweeper-like constraints. The grid contains standard Sudoku clues (pre-filled numbers) and "mine-count clues" where specific cells must count neighboring mines.

## Instance Data

### Sudoku Clues (Pre-filled Cells)

The following cells are fixed and cannot be changed:
```
5 _ _ | _ 7 _ | _ _ 2
_ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
_ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
------+-------+------
4 _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
_ _ _ | _ 5 _ | _ _ 1
_ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
------+-------+------
_ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
_ _ _ | _ _ _ | _ _ _
3 _ _ | _ 8 _ | _ _ 9
```

Coordinates (0-indexed):
- (0,0): 5, (0,4): 7, (0,8): 2
- (4,0): 4, (4,4): 5, (4,8): 1
- (8,0): 3, (8,4): 8, (8,8): 9

### Mine-Count Clue Locations

The following cells must contain values equal to their count of neighboring mines:
- (0,1)
- (3,1)
- (5,7)

A cell is a **mine** if it contains an **even digit** (2, 4, 6, or 8).

## Constraints

1. **Standard Sudoku rules**: Each row, column, and 3×3 box must contain digits 1-9 **exactly** once
2. **Sudoku clues (hints)**: The 9 pre-filled cells are provided as hints. **If they conflict with mine-count constraints, the mine-count constraints take priority** and clue values may need to change
3. **Mine definition**: A cell is a mine if and only if its value is **even**
4. **Mine-count clues**: Each mine-count clue cell's value **must equal** the number of its 8 neighbors (orthogonal and diagonal) that are mines

**Constraint Priority:** Mine-count clues (Constraint 4) have highest priority. If satisfying them requires changing initial Sudoku clues, those changes are allowed.

## Objective

Find a complete 9×9 grid satisfying all Sudoku and Minesweeper constraints.

### Field Descriptions

- `grid`: 9×9 array of integers (1-9), the complete solution
- `mines`: Array of [row, col] coordinates for all cells containing even numbers
- `is_valid_sudoku`: Boolean, true if grid satisfies all Sudoku rules
- `sudoku_clues_preserved`: Boolean, true if all 9 pre-filled cells remain unchanged (false if mine-count constraints required changes)
- `mine_clues_satisfied`: Boolean, true if all 3 mine-count clues are correct (highest priority)


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers for this problem. The problem is a Sudoku with additional constraints about mines (even digits) and mine-count clues. This is a combinatorial puzzle with numeric constraints, counting neighbors, and Sudoku constraints (all-different rows/cols/boxes). This is essentially a CSP with arithmetic constraints and counting. Z3 (SMT) is suitable for numeric constraints, counting, and Sudoku constraints can be encoded with integer variables and all-different constraints. CLINGO could also handle Sudoku via ASP with constraints and counting neighbors, but counting neighbor mines (even digits) is doable with aggregates. However, the problem includes priority where some Sudoku clues may be changed; that's a soft constraint but can be encoded as optional. Both CLINGO and Z3 can handle. VAMPIRE is for first-order logic entailment, not suitable for numeric counting and Sudoku constraints. So ranking: Most suitable Z3, second CLINGO, least VAMPIRE.
