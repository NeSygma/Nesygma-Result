 Query: # Problem Statement

Analyze pharmaceutical safety by determining safe drug combinations for patients with multiple conditions. Given a patient's medical conditions and contraindications, along with available drugs and their properties, find an optimal prescription that treats the patient's conditions while avoiding dangerous drug interactions and respecting contraindications.

## Instance Data

**Patient:**
- Conditions: pain, hypertension, diabetes
- Contraindications: bleeding_disorder
- Maximum drugs allowed: 3

**Available Drugs:**

1. **drug1** (Aspirin - display name only)
   - Drug ID: `drug1`
   - Treats: pain, inflammation
   - Contraindications: bleeding_disorder
   - Max dose: 4000 mg
   - Interactions: with drug2 (increased_bleeding, moderate severity)

2. **drug2** (Warfarin - display name only)
   - Drug ID: `drug2`
   - Treats: blood_clot_prevention
   - Contraindications: pregnancy
   - Max dose: 10 mg
   - Interactions: with drug1 (increased_bleeding, moderate severity)

3. **drug3** (Lisinopril - display name only)
   - Drug ID: `drug3`
   - Treats: hypertension
   - Contraindications: kidney_disease
   - Max dose: 40 mg
   - Interactions: with drug4 (mild_nausea, mild severity)

4. **drug4** (Metformin - display name only)
   - Drug ID: `drug4`
   - Treats: diabetes
   - Contraindications: kidney_disease
   - Max dose: 2000 mg
   - Interactions: with drug3 (mild_nausea, mild severity)

5. **drug5** (Ibuprofen - display name only)
   - Drug ID: `drug5`
   - Treats: pain, inflammation
   - Contraindications: none
   - Max dose: 2400 mg
   - Interactions: with drug3 (reduced_bp_effect, moderate severity)

**Important:** Use drug IDs (`drug1`, `drug2`, etc.) in all outputs, not display names (Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.).

## Constraints

1. **Maximum drugs**: Select **no more than** the patient's maximum allowed drugs (3 in this instance).
2. **Contraindications**: **Cannot** prescribe drugs that match any of the patient's contraindications.
3. **Dosage**: Each prescribed drug **must** have a dose between 1 and the drug's max_dose.
4. **Treatment coverage**: A condition is treated if **at least one** prescribed drug treats that condition.

## Objective

Find a prescription that **maximizes** the number of treated patient conditions while **minimizing** the severity of drug interactions (severe > moderate > mild).

Expected optimal solution: Prescribes 2 drugs (Metformin and Ibuprofen) treating 2 conditions (diabetes and pain) with total interaction cost = 0.

**Field Descriptions:**
- `prescribed_drugs`: List of prescribed drugs with `drug_id` (use drug IDs like "drug1", "drug4", not display names), dose (mg), and frequency
- `treated_conditions`: List of patient conditions that are treated by at least one prescribed drug
- `untreated_conditions`: List of patient conditions not covered by any prescribed drug
- `safety_analysis.interactions_detected`: List of all pairwise interactions between prescribed drugs (use drug IDs in the `drugs` array)
- `safety_analysis.contraindications_avoided`: List of patient contraindications (informational)
- `safety_analysis.safety_score`: Float in [0, 1] indicating overall safety (higher is safer)

**Safety Score Calculation:**
The `safety_score` is calculated using the following formula:

```
safety_score = 0.5 + coverage_bonus - total_penalty
```

Where:
- Base safety score: `0.5`
- Coverage bonus: `(treated_conditions / total_conditions) * 0.5`
  - Example: If 3 out of 3 conditions are treated: `(3/3) * 0.5 = 0.5`
  - Example: If 2 out of 3 conditions are treated: `(2/3) * 0.5 ≈ 0.33`
- Total penalty: Sum of interaction penalties for all detected interactions:
  - `severe` interaction: `-0.3` per interaction
  - `moderate` interaction: `-0.15` per interaction
  - `mild` interaction: `-0.05` per interaction

The final `safety_score` is clamped to the range [0, 1].

**Example:** If a prescription treats all 3 conditions and has 1 moderate interaction:
- `safety_score = 0.5 + 0.5 - 0.15 = 0.85`

**Important:** The `drug_id` field must contain the drug identifier (e.g., "drug1", "drug4"), NOT the display name (e.g., "Aspirin", "Metformin").


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers for this problem. The problem is about selecting a subset of drugs (up to 3) with dosage constraints, covering conditions, avoiding contraindications, minimizing interaction severity. This is a combinatorial optimization / constraint satisfaction with numeric constraints (dose ranges, max drugs, interaction severity). This fits Z3 (SMT) best: variables for each drug (bool selected, dose int), constraints, objective to maximize coverage and minimize penalty. Could also be CLINGO (ASP) because it's combinatorial with constraints and optimization (minimize severity). However there are numeric dosage ranges (1 to max dose) which are integers; ASP can handle integers but large ranges may cause grounding blow-up. Here max doses up to 4000 mg, but dosage can be any integer between 1 and max; that is large domain, not ideal for ASP. Z3 handles arithmetic well. VAMPIRE is for first-order logic entailment, not optimization, not numeric constraints. So ranking: most suitable Z3, second CLINGO (maybe but less due to large numeric domain), least VAMPIRE.
