 Query: # Problem Statement

Fill a 24×24 grid with colors from the palette {0=white, 1=red, 2=green, 3=blue} such that each row satisfies its colored run clues in left-to-right order, each column satisfies its colored run clues in top-to-bottom order, the main diagonal matches an exact sequence, and the anti-diagonal matches an exact sequence.

**Main diagonal** (grid[i][i] for i=0..23):
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

**Anti-diagonal** (grid[i][23-i] for i=0..23):
[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]

## Constraints

1. Each **row** must satisfy its colored run clues in left-to-right order. A run clue `(color, length)` means **exactly** `length` consecutive cells of that color - no more, no less.
2. Each **column** must satisfy its colored run clues in top-to-bottom order. A run clue `(color, length)` means **exactly** `length` consecutive cells of that color - no more, no less.
3. The **main diagonal** (grid[i][i] for i=0..23) must match the exact sequence specified above
4. The **anti-diagonal** (grid[i][23-i] for i=0..23) must match the exact sequence specified above
5. **White cells (0)** are ignored when determining runs; runs of the same color must be separated by at least one cell of a different color (or white)
6. **Grid cells** must contain values from {0, 1, 2, 3}
7. **Exhaustiveness of clues**: The clues for each row or column are a complete and exhaustive list of all colored runs. Any cell not belonging to one of the specified runs **must be white (color 0)**. No additional colored cells are allowed beyond those defined by the clues.

**Example for an 8-cell row with clue [(1,3), (2,2)]:**
- ✅ Valid: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0]` - contains exactly the specified runs, all other cells white
- ❌ Invalid: `[1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3]` - contains an extra unclued run of color 3
- ❌ Invalid: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0]` - first run has length 4 instead of exactly 3

## Objective

Find any valid solution that satisfies all row clues, column clues, main diagonal constraints, and anti-diagonal constraints.

### Field Descriptions

- **grid**: A 24×24 array where each element is an integer in {0, 1, 2, 3} representing the color at that cell (0-indexed)
- **valid**: Boolean indicating if the solution is valid
- **palette**: Mapping from color codes to color names


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers for this problem. The problem is a nonogram-like puzzle with colored runs, plus diagonal constraints. This is a combinatorial constraint satisfaction problem with exact runs, positions, and colored cells. It involves assigning colors to a 24x24 grid, with constraints about runs in rows and columns, plus exact sequences on diagonals. This is essentially a CSP with finite domain variables (each cell integer 0-3) and constraints about runs (global constraints). This is not a pure logical entailment (VAMPIRE) because it's not about entailment but about constructing a configuration. It's not purely numeric but combinatorial with constraints. CLINGO (ASP) is good for combinatorial search with constraints, especially nonogram puzzles. It can handle run constraints via generate and test, and diagonal constraints. Z3 can also handle such constraints using integer variables and constraints, but handling run constraints (exact sequences with whites separating) is more complex but possible using regular expressions or automata constraints. However, Z3 is more suited for numeric constraints and ordering; but can also encode with Boolean variables per cell and constraints. However, CLINGO is more natural for nonogram puzzles. So ranking: most suitable CLINGO, second Z3, least VAMPIRE.
