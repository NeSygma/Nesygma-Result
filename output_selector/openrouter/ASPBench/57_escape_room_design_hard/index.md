 Query: # Problem Statement

Design a multi-room escape experience with 18 puzzles. The design must create a cohesive player journey by managing puzzle dependencies, item collection, room progression, thematic balance, and a smooth difficulty curve.

## Instance Data

### Room Layout
- **5 rooms** arranged linearly: R1-R2-R3-R4-R5
- Players can only move between **adjacent rooms** (e.g., R1↔R2, R2↔R3, R3↔R4, R4↔R5)

### Puzzle Specifications
18 puzzles with the following properties:

| ID | Room | Difficulty | Theme | Prerequisites | Requires Items | Yields Items |
|----|------|------------|-------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| 1 | R1 | 1 | search | - | - | - |
| 2 | R1 | 1 | logic | [1] | - | key_red |
| 3 | R2 | 2 | physical | [2] | - | - |
| 4 | R2 | 2 | search | [3] | key_red | - |
| 5 | R2 | 2 | logic | [4] | - | uv_light |
| 6 | R1 | 3 | search | [5] | uv_light | - |
| 7 | R1 | 3 | logic | [6] | - | key_blue |
| 8 | R2 | 3 | physical | [7] | - | crowbar |
| 9 | R3 | 3 | search | [8] | key_blue | - |
| 10 | R4 | 3 | physical | [9] | crowbar | - |
| 11 | R4 | 4 | logic | [10] | - | - |
| 12 | R3 | 4 | search | [11] | uv_light | - |
| 13 | R3 | 4 | logic | [12] | - | gear_1 |
| 14 | R4 | 4 | search | [13] | - | - |
| 15 | R5 | 4 | physical | [14] | crowbar | gear_2 |
| 16 | R5 | 5 | logic | [15] | - | - |
| 17 | R5 | 5 | search | [16] | uv_light | gear_3 |
| 18 | R5 | 5 | logic | [17] | key_red, key_blue | - |

### Items
- **key_red**: yielded by puzzle 2, required by puzzles 4 and 18
- **key_blue**: yielded by puzzle 7, required by puzzles 9 and 18
- **uv_light**: yielded by puzzle 5, required by puzzles 6, 12, and 17
- **crowbar**: yielded by puzzle 8, required by puzzles 10 and 15
- **gear_1, gear_2, gear_3**: yielded by puzzles 13, 15, and 17 (not required by any puzzle)

## Constraints

1. **Prerequisite Constraint**: A puzzle can only be solved after all its prerequisite puzzles have been completed.

2. **Item Requirement Constraint**: A puzzle that requires items can only be solved when all required items are in the player's inventory.

3. **Room Adjacency Constraint**: Players can only move between adjacent rooms. The room of puzzle N and puzzle N+1 must be either the same or adjacent.

4. **Theme Balance Constraint**: No two consecutive puzzles can have the same theme.

5. **Difficulty Curve Constraint**: The difficulty difference between consecutive puzzles must be at most 1.

## Objective

Find **any** valid puzzle ordering that satisfies all constraints.

### Field Descriptions

- **puzzle_order**: List of puzzle IDs in the order they should be solved
- **room_progression**: List of room names corresponding to each puzzle in the order
- **difficulty_progression**: List of difficulty levels corresponding to each puzzle in the order
- **theme_progression**: List of themes corresponding to each puzzle in the order
- **all_constraints_satisfied**: Boolean indicating if all constraints are met (should be true)
- **puzzle_details**: Complete list of all 18 puzzles with their properties


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers based on problem type. The problem: find any valid ordering of puzzles satisfying constraints: prerequisites (partial order), item requirements, adjacency constraints (rooms adjacency), theme balance (no same consecutive theme), difficulty difference <=1. This is essentially a scheduling / ordering problem with constraints, akin to a CSP / planning problem. It involves discrete items, constraints, ordering, adjacency, etc. No quantifiers, no numeric arithmetic beyond small integers, but constraints are combinatorial. This is a classic constraint satisfaction / planning problem, suitable for answer set programming (Clingo) or SAT/SMT. Z3 could also handle ordering with integer variables representing positions and constraints, but there are many constraints like adjacency of rooms, theme not equal, difficulty diff <=1, prerequisites (partial order). Z3 can handle these with integer variables and constraints, but it's more natural for CSP. However, Clingo is designed for combinatorial search with generate-and-test, closed-world, constraints, and can easily encode ordering with positions and constraints. Z3 also can do it, but might be less natural due to need for encoding ordering and all-different constraints. VAMPIRE is for first-order logic entailment, not suitable.
- Thus ranking: most suitable: CLINGO. Second: Z3. Least: VAMPIRE.
