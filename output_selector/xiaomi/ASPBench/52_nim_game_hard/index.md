 Query: # Problem Statement

In Quantum Nim, two players take turns removing stones from piles, but each player has a unique one-time-use "Quantum Power". Player 1 can **split** an even-sized pile into two piles, and Player 2 can **merge** two piles into one. The goal is to take the last stone. Given the current game state, determine all optimal moves for the current player that lead to a winning position.

## Instance Data

- **Piles**: 4 piles with stone counts [6, 7, 10, 13]
- **Current player**: Player 1
- **Powers available**: Player 1 has split power (available), Player 2 has merge power (available)

## Constraints

1. **Standard moves**: Remove N stones (1 ≤ N ≤ pile_size) from any pile
2. **Split power**: Player 1 can split any even-sized pile into two non-empty piles (one-time use)
3. **State validity**: After any move, no two piles can have the same size
4. **Optimality**: A move is optimal if it results in a nim-sum of 0 (forces opponent into losing position)

## Objective

Find **all** optimal moves that lead to a nim-sum of 0. Expected optimal: **3 standard moves**.

### Field Descriptions

- **initial_nim_sum**: Integer, bitwise XOR of all pile sizes
- **is_winning_position**: Boolean, true if nim-sum is non-zero
- **optimal_moves**: Array of move objects, each containing:
  - **move_type**: String, "standard" or "power_split"
  - **pile_index**: Integer, index of pile being modified (0-indexed)
  - **stones_removed**: Integer (standard moves only), number of stones removed
  - **split_into**: Array of 2 integers (split moves only), sizes of resulting piles
  - **resulting_piles**: Array of integers, sorted pile sizes after the move
- **analysis**: String, human-readable description of the solution
