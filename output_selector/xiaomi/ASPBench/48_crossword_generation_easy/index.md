 Query: # Problem Statement

Generate a themed crossword puzzle on a 5x5 grid where words intersect at matching letters. Given a technology theme, place 6 words (CODE, DATA, TECH, CHIP, BYTE, NET) such that they form a valid crossword with proper intersections.

## Instance Data

**Grid Size:** 5x5

- BYTE (4 letters) - "Data unit"
- NET (3 letters) - "Internet short"

## Constraints

1. **All words placed:** Each word must be placed exactly once in the grid
2. **Valid directions:** Words can only be placed horizontally (left-to-right) or vertically (top-to-bottom)
3. **Within bounds:** All letters of each word must fit within the 5x5 grid
4. **No conflicts:** Letters at the same grid position must be identical
5. **Intersections required:** Words should intersect at matching letters where possible
