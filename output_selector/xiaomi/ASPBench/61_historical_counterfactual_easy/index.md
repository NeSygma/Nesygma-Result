 Query: # Problem Statement

Analyze alternative history scenarios by modeling historical events with causal dependencies. Given a set of events with prerequisite relationships and an intervention that prevents a specific event, determine the resulting alternate timeline and identify which events are prevented through causal cascades.

## Instance Data

**Events:**
1. `discovery_of_america` (1492) - Discovery of America - no prerequisites
2. `columbian_exchange` (1500) - Columbian Exchange - requires `discovery_of_america`
3. `spanish_empire` (1520) - Spanish Empire - requires `discovery_of_america`
4. `industrial_revolution` (1750) - Industrial Revolution - requires `spanish_empire`
5. `world_wars` (1914) - World Wars - requires `industrial_revolution`

**Causal Dependencies:**
- `discovery_of_america` enables: `columbian_exchange`, `spanish_empire`
- `spanish_empire` enables: `industrial_revolution`
- `industrial_revolution` enables: `world_wars`

**Intervention:**
- Prevent `discovery_of_america`

## Constraints

1. **Original timeline**: All events occur in chronological order with **all** prerequisites satisfied
2. **Prevented events**: Any event with a prevented prerequisite is also prevented (cascade effect)
3. **Alternate timeline**: Events that are **not** prevented and have satisfied prerequisites occur in chronological order
4. **Direct effects**: Events immediately enabled by the prevented event
5. **Cascade effects**: Events prevented indirectly through dependency chains
6. **Preserved events**: Events that remain in the alternate timeline

## Objective

Determine the complete causal analysis showing which events are prevented directly, which through cascades, and which remain in the alternate timeline.

**Field Descriptions:**
- `original_timeline`: List of all event IDs in chronological order (original history)
- `alternate_timeline`: List of event IDs that occur after the intervention, in chronological order
- `prevented_events`: List of all prevented event IDs (directly and through cascades)
- `causal_analysis.direct_effects`: Event IDs immediately enabled by the prevented event
- `causal_analysis.cascade_effects`: Event IDs prevented through dependency chains
- `causal_analysis.preserved_events`: Event IDs not prevented by the intervention
- `causal_analysis.intervention_events`: The event ID(s) directly prevented by intervention

**Important:** All event identifiers must use snake_case format (e.g., `discovery_of_america`, not "Discovery of America").
