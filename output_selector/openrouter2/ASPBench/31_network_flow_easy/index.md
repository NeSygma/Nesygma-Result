 Query: # Problem Statement

Find the maximum flow through a network from source to sink, where each directed edge has a capacity constraint.

## Instance Data

**Network:**
- Nodes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- Source: 1
- Sink: 6

**Edges with capacities:**
- 1 → 2: capacity 10
- 1 → 3: capacity 8
- 2 → 3: capacity 5
- 2 → 4: capacity 7
- 3 → 4: capacity 3
- 3 → 5: capacity 9
- 4 → 6: capacity 8
- 5 → 6: capacity 6

## Constraints

1. **Capacity constraint**: Flow on each edge **must not exceed** its capacity
2. **Non-negativity**: Flow on each edge **must be** non-negative
3. **Flow conservation**: For **all** intermediate nodes (not source or sink), total incoming flow **must equal** total outgoing flow

## Objective

Find a solution that **maximizes** the total flow from source to sink.

**Expected optimal value:** max_flow = 14

**Field descriptions:**
- `max_flow` (number): Total flow from source to sink
- `flows` (array): List of flow values for each edge
  - `from` (number): Source node of the edge
  - `to` (number): Target node of the edge
  - `flow` (number): Amount of flow on this edge (0 ≤ flow ≤ capacity)


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers for this problem. The problem is a maximum flow problem, a classic network flow optimization. The solver types: VAMPIRE (first-order logic), CLINGO (ASP), Z3 (SMT). Which is most suitable? The problem is a numeric optimization with constraints. Z3 can handle integer arithmetic and optimization. CLINGO can handle combinatorial constraints but not optimization? It can do optimization with #minimize but not numeric capacities? It can handle integer variables but not continuous? It can handle integer constraints but not optimization of flow? It can but might be heavy. VAMPIRE is for logical entailment, not numeric optimization. So ranking: Z3 most suitable, CLINGO second, VAMPIRE least. Provide JSON.
