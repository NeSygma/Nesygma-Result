 Query: # Problem Statement

Schedule a double round-robin tournament for 4 teams where each pair plays exactly twice (once at each team's home venue) across 6 rounds, while minimizing total travel distance.

## Instance Data

**Teams and Locations:**
- Team A: (0, 0)
- Team B: (3, 4)
- Team C: (6, 0)
- Team D: (2, 8)

**Distance Matrix (Euclidean):**
```
     A    B    C    D
A    0    5    6   8.2
B    5    0    5   5.7
C    6    5    0   10
D  8.2  5.7   10   0
```

**Tournament Structure:**
- 6 rounds total
- 2 matches per round (4 teams = 2 simultaneous matches)
- 12 total matches (each pair plays twice with home/away swapped)

**Travel Model:**
Teams travel from their home city to opponent's city for away games. Teams return home after each round.

## Constraints

1. **Double round-robin**: Each pair of teams plays **exactly** twice (once home, once away)
2. **Round structure**: Each round has **exactly** 2 matches
3. **Team availability**: Each team plays **exactly** once per round
4. **Consecutive limit**: **No** team plays more than 2 consecutive home games
5. **Consecutive limit**: **No** team plays more than 2 consecutive away games

## Objective

Find a schedule that **minimizes** total travel distance for all teams across all rounds.

**Expected optimal total distance: 75**

Where:
- `schedule`: List of 6 rounds, each containing 2 match objects
- Each match: `{"home": "X", "away": "Y"}` where team X hosts team Y
- `total_distance`: Integer sum of all away team travel distances
- `feasible`: Boolean indicating if all constraints are satisfied


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers: VAMPIRE, CLINGO, Z3. Problem: scheduling double round-robin tournament with constraints and objective minimize travel distance. This is a combinatorial optimization with numeric constraints. We need to find schedule that satisfies constraints and minimize total travel distance. This is a constraint satisfaction / optimization problem with numeric objective. Z3 is best for such optimization with integer variables, constraints, objective. CLINGO could also handle combinatorial search but optimization may be more complex; but CLINGO can handle optimization with #minimize. However, the problem includes numeric distances and objective sum. CLINGO can handle numeric constraints but may need to encode distances as constants. It can handle optimization. But Z3 is more natural for numeric optimization. VAMPIRE is for theorem proving, not suitable. So ranking: Z3 most suitable, CLINGO second, VAMPIRE least. Provide JSON.
