 Query: # Problem Statement

Schedule 5 meetings over 3 days with optimal room assignment and minimal preference violations. Each meeting has required attendees, and some meetings have preferred time slots.

## Instance Data

**Days:** 3 days (1, 2, 3)
**Time slots per day:** 3 slots (1, 2, 3)
**Rooms:** r1 (conference room), r2 (meeting room)

**Meetings:**
- m1: Project kickoff meeting
- m2: Budget review meeting
- m3: Technical design session
- m4: Client presentation
- m5: Team retrospective meeting

**People:**
- p1: Alice (Project Manager)
- p2: Bob (Developer)
- p3: Carol (Designer)
- p4: Dave (Client)
- p5: Eve (Finance)

**Required Attendees:**
- m1: p1, p2, p3 (Alice, Bob, Carol)
- m2: p1, p5 (Alice, Eve)
- m3: p2, p3 (Bob, Carol)
- m4: p1, p4 (Alice, Dave)
- m5: p1, p2, p3 (Alice, Bob, Carol)

**Time Preferences:**
- m1: day 1, slot 1 (morning kickoff)
- m2: day 1, slot 2 (afternoon budget review)
- m4: day 3, slot 3 (final client presentation)

## Constraints

1. **Each meeting** must be assigned exactly one time slot and one room
2. **No person** can attend two meetings at the same time slot
3. **Only one meeting** per room per time slot
4. **All required attendees** must be available

## Objective

Find a schedule that **minimizes** preference violations (penalty +1 for each meeting not scheduled at its preferred time).

**Expected optimal violations: 0**

**Fields:**
- `schedule`: Array of meeting assignments (meeting ID, day, slot, room)
- `conflicts`: Array of constraint violations (empty if feasible)
- `preference_violations`: Number of meetings not at preferred time
- `feasible`: Boolean indicating if valid schedule exists


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers: VAMPIRE, CLINGO, Z3. Problem: scheduling 5 meetings over 3 days, 3 slots each, 2 rooms. Constraints: each meeting assigned exactly one time slot and one room; no person can attend two meetings at same time; only one meeting per room per time slot; all required attendees must be available. Objective: minimize preference violations. This is a combinatorial optimization / scheduling problem with constraints and objective. We need to find schedule that satisfies constraints and minimize violations. This is a constraint satisfaction problem with optimization. Which solver is best? Z3 is good for constraint satisfaction with numeric variables, optimization. CLINGO is also good for combinatorial search, but optimization? It can handle optimization with #minimize. But the problem is small; but we need to find schedule that satisfies constraints and minimize violations. CLINGO can handle optimization. But Z3 is more natural for scheduling with integer variables and constraints. VAMPIRE is for theorem proving, not suitable. So ranking: Z3 most suitable, CLINGO second, VAMPIRE least. Provide JSON.
