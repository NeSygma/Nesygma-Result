 Query: # Problem Statement

Generate a playable roguelike dungeon with connected rooms, strategic treasure placement, and balanced monster distribution.

## Instance Data

**7 Rooms:**
- room1 (entrance, small) → connects to room2, room3
- room2 (chamber, large) → connects to room1, room4
- room3 (corridor, small) → connects to room1, room5
- room4 (chamber, medium) → connects to room2, room6
- room5 (treasury, medium) → connects to room3, room6, room7
- room6 (corridor, small) → connects to room4, room5
- room7 (boss_room, large) → connects to room5

**3 Treasures:**
- treasure1: value=100, rarity=common
- treasure2: value=500, rarity=rare
- treasure3: value=1000, rarity=legendary

**3 Monster Types:**
- goblin: danger_level=2, group_size=3
- orc: danger_level=4, group_size=2
- dragon: danger_level=8, group_size=1

**Constraints:**
- Maximum danger per room: 10
- Minimum treasures per path to exit: 1

## Constraints

1. **Treasure placement**: Each treasure must be placed in **exactly** one room
2. **Monster placement**: Monsters can be placed in multiple rooms, respecting group size limits
3. **Danger limit**: Each room's total danger (**must** not exceed 10)
4. **Connectivity**: **All** rooms must be reachable from the entrance
5. **Strategic placement**: Rare treasures should be in higher-danger rooms than common treasures

## Objective

Generate a valid dungeon layout that satisfies **all** connectivity and danger constraints while maintaining strategic treasure placement.

**Field Descriptions:**
- `room_layout`: Array of room configurations with monsters, treasures, and danger levels
- `connectivity.paths`: Paths from entrance to exit with danger totals and treasures
- `connectivity.isolated_rooms`: List of unreachable rooms (should be empty)
- `balance_analysis.total_danger`: Sum of all room danger levels
- `balance_analysis.treasure_distribution`: Count of treasures by rarity
- `balance_analysis.difficulty_progression`: Overall difficulty rating (easy/balanced/hard/extreme)


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers for this problem. The problem is about generating a dungeon layout with constraints: placement of treasures, monsters, danger limits, connectivity, strategic placement. It's a combinatorial search with constraints, assignment of treasures to rooms, monsters to rooms, ensuring danger per room <=10, connectivity, etc. This is a constraint satisfaction problem with numeric constraints and graph connectivity. The solver that best fits is Z3 (SMT) because it can handle integer variables, constraints, connectivity (maybe via graph constraints). Clingo could also handle combinatorial search, but connectivity constraints might be more complex. Z3 is good for numeric constraints and cardinality. VAMPIRE is for first-order logic entailment, not suitable. So ranking: Z3 most suitable, Clingo second, VAMPIRE least. Provide JSON.
