 Query: # Problem Statement

Complete a partially filled 5×5 Latin square where each row and column must contain each number from 1 to 5 exactly once.

## Instance Data

Complete this 5×5 grid with some cells already filled:

```
Row 1: [1, _, _, _, _]
Row 2: [_, _, 3, _, _]
Row 3: [_, _, _, 4, _]
Row 4: [_, _, _, _, 5]
Row 5: [_, 2, _, _, _]
```

Where `_` represents empty cells to be filled.

**Given constraints:**
- Cell (1,1) = 1
- Cell (2,3) = 3
- Cell (3,4) = 4
- Cell (4,5) = 5
- Cell (5,2) = 2

## Constraints

1. **Each row** must contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 exactly once
2. **Each column** must contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 exactly once
3. **All given values** must remain fixed in their positions

## Objective

Find a complete assignment of numbers to all empty cells that satisfies all constraints.

**Fields:**
- `grid`: 5×5 array where `grid[i][j]` is the number in row i+1, column j+1 (0-indexed)
- `solved`: Boolean indicating if a solution was found


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers: VAMPIRE, CLINGO, Z3. Problem: Latin square completion. It's a constraint satisfaction problem with numeric values 1-5, each row/column must contain each number exactly once. This is a classic CSP with finite domain. We need to assign numbers to cells. This is a combinatorial search with constraints. The best solver: Z3 (SMT) can handle integer constraints, Distinct, etc. CLINGO can also handle combinatorial search with constraints, but it's more natural for logic programming. However, Z3 is more suited for numeric constraints and Distinct. VAMPIRE is for first-order logic entailment, not suitable. So ranking: Z3 > CLINGO > VAMPIRE. Provide JSON.
