 Query: # Problem Statement

Allocate 4 types of limited resources to 12 tasks to maximize total value. Tasks are grouped into 3 categories and are subject to complex inter-dependencies, including prerequisites, mutual exclusions, conditional resource costs, and a diversity-based value bonus.

## Instance Data

**Tasks** (12 total, grouped into 3 categories):

| ID | Category | Value | Compute | Bandwidth | Storage | Specialists |
|----|----------|-------|---------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 0  | Research | 40    | 20      | 10        | 30      | 5           |
| 1  | Research | 60    | 30      | 25        | 20      | 10          |
| 2  | Research | 70    | 25      | 20        | 15      | 5           |
| 3  | Research | 55    | 20      | 15        | 25      | 10          |
| 4  | Development | 80 | 40      | 30        | 20      | 20          |
| 5  | Development | 90 | 35      | 25        | 30      | 15          |
| 6  | Development | 75 | 30      | 40        | 25      | 18          |
| 7  | Development | 85 | 45      | 35        | 15      | 22          |
| 8  | Deployment | 65  | 15      | 20        | 40      | 8           |
| 9  | Deployment | 80  | 20      | 30        | 35      | 12          |
| 10 | Deployment | 70  | 25      | 25        | 30      | 10          |
| 11 | Deployment | 95  | 30      | 35        | 45      | 15          |

**Resource Capacities:**
- Compute: 150
- Bandwidth: 120
- Storage: 140
- Specialists: 60

**Dependencies:**
- Prerequisite: Task 4 requires Task 0
- Mutual Exclusion: Task 1 and Task 7 cannot both be selected

**Conditional Cost:**
- If **at least** one Development task (4-7) is selected, **each** selected Deployment task (8-11) incurs an **additional cost of 5 Specialist units** (on top of base cost)

**Diversity Bonus:**
- If the selection includes **at least** one task from **each** of the three categories (Research, Development, Deployment), a bonus of **100** is added to the total value

## Constraints

1. **Resource Limits:** The total consumption for each of the four resources **cannot** exceed its capacity.
2. **Task Selection:** Each task can be selected **at most** once (0-1 selection).
3. **Prerequisite:** Task 4 can **only** be selected if Task 0 is also selected.
4. **Mutual Exclusion:** Task 1 and Task 7 **cannot** be selected together.
5. **Conditional Specialist Cost:** If **at least** one Development task (4-7) is selected, **each** selected Deployment task (8-11) incurs an **additional cost of 5 Specialist units** on top of its base cost.
6. **Diversity Value Bonus:** If the selection includes **at least** one task from **each** of the three categories (Research, Development, Deployment), a bonus of **100** is added to the total value.

## Objective

Find a solution that **maximizes** the total value, which is the sum of the values of selected tasks plus any applicable diversity bonus.

**Expected optimal total value: 470**

### Field Descriptions

- `selected_tasks`: Array of integers - IDs of selected tasks (sorted)
- `total_value`: Integer - Total value including base task values and diversity bonus if achieved
- `bonus_achieved`: Boolean - Whether the diversity bonus was achieved (tasks from all 3 categories)
- `resource_usage`: Object with four fields:
  - `compute`: Integer - Total compute units used (including base costs only)
  - `bandwidth`: Integer - Total bandwidth units used
  - `storage`: Integer - Total storage units used
  - `specialists`: Integer - Total specialist units used (including both base costs and conditional costs)


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers: VAMPIRE, CLINGO, Z3. Problem: allocate 4 types of limited resources to 12 tasks to maximize total value. It's a combinatorial optimization with constraints, resource capacities, prerequisites, mutual exclusion, conditional cost, diversity bonus. This is a typical integer programming / constraint satisfaction optimization problem. We need to find optimal solution. Which solver is best? Z3 is good for constraint satisfaction with numeric constraints, optimization. CLINGO is good for combinatorial search, but optimization? It can handle optimization with #minimize. But the problem includes numeric constraints and optimization. CLINGO can handle integer arithmetic but may struggle with large numeric ranges? But here capacities are moderate. However, CLINGO is more for logic programming, not heavy arithmetic. Z3 is specifically for SMT with arithmetic, optimization. VAMPIRE is for first-order logic entailment, not optimization. So ranking: Z3 most suitable, CLINGO second, VAMPIRE least. Provide JSON.
