 Query: # Problem Statement

Solve the cryptarithmetic puzzle DONALD + GERALD = ROBERT where each letter represents a unique digit.

## Instance Data

The puzzle is: **DONALD + GERALD = ROBERT**

Letters involved: D, O, N, A, L, G, E, R, B, T (10 unique letters)

Each letter must be assigned a digit from 0-9, and all 10 digits must be used exactly once.

## Constraints

1. **Unique Digits:** Each of the 10 unique letters (D, O, N, A, L, G, E, R, B, T) must be assigned a different digit from 0-9. Consequently, all digits from 0 to 9 are used exactly once.
2. **Leading Zeros:** The leading letters of the numbers (D, G, and R) cannot be assigned the digit 0.
3. **Arithmetic Correctness:** The assignment of digits to letters must satisfy the following columnar addition:
   ```
     D O N A L D
   + G E R A L D
   -------------
   = R O B E R T
   ```

## Objective

Find **any** valid digit assignment that satisfies all constraints.

### Field Descriptions

- `assignment`: Dictionary mapping each letter (uppercase) to its assigned digit (0-9)
- `equation`: String showing the arithmetic equation with numbers
- `valid`: Boolean indicating whether the solution is valid


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers for this cryptarithmetic puzzle. The puzzle is a constraint satisfaction problem with 10 variables each a digit 0-9, all distinct, leading digits non-zero, and addition constraint. This is a classic CSP with arithmetic constraints. Which solver is best? Z3 is good for arithmetic constraints, integer variables, Distinct, etc. Clingo can also handle combinatorial search with constraints, but might need to encode arithmetic addition as constraints. Z3 is more natural. VAMPIRE is for first-order logic entailment, not suitable. So ranking: Z3 most suitable, Clingo second, VAMPIRE least. Provide JSON.
