 Query: # Problem Statement

Fold a 10-residue protein sequence on a 2D lattice to find a configuration with the minimum possible energy. The HP (Hydrophobic-Polar) model maximizes non-sequential contacts between Hydrophobic (H) residues.

## Instance Data

**Protein Sequence:** HPHPHHPHPH (10 residues)

**Residue Types:**
- Position 1: H (Hydrophobic)
- Position 2: P (Polar)
- Position 3: H (Hydrophobic)
- Position 4: P (Polar)
- Position 5: H (Hydrophobic)
- Position 6: H (Hydrophobic)
- Position 7: P (Polar)
- Position 8: H (Hydrophobic)
- Position 9: P (Polar)
- Position 10: H (Hydrophobic)

**Energy Model:** Each pair of non-sequential H residues on adjacent lattice points contributes -1 to the total energy.

## Constraints

1. **Self-avoiding walk:** Each residue must occupy a unique lattice point (no two residues at the same position)
2. **Connectivity:** Consecutive residues in the sequence must occupy adjacent lattice points (Manhattan distance = 1)
3. **Non-sequential contacts:** Only residue pairs (i, j) where |i - j| > 1 contribute to energy
4. **Adjacency:** Two lattice points are adjacent if their Manhattan distance equals 1

## Objective

Find a self-avoiding walk on a 2D integer lattice that **minimizes** the total energy.

**Expected minimum energy:** -4

**Field Descriptions:**
- `sequence`: The protein sequence (must be "HPHPHHPHPH")
- `coordinates`: List of 10 [x, y] coordinate pairs, one for each residue in sequence order


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers: VAMPIRE, CLINGO, Z3. Problem: protein folding on 2D lattice, find configuration minimizing energy. This is a combinatorial optimization / constraint satisfaction problem with numeric constraints (positions, adjacency, self-avoiding, energy). We need to find configuration that satisfies constraints and minimize energy. This is a typical CSP with integer variables (coordinates). Z3 is good for such constraints: integer arithmetic, Distinct, adjacency constraints, objective minimize. CLINGO could also handle combinatorial search but might struggle with numeric constraints and optimization. VAMPIRE is for first-order logic entailment, not suitable. So ranking: Z3 most suitable, CLINGO second, VAMPIRE least. Provide JSON.
