 Query: Premises:
If a film is appropriate for people of all ages, then children can watch it without guidance from parents.
If a film contains excessive erotic and violent content, children cannot watch it without guidance from their parents.
If a film is rated General Audience, then it is appropriate for people of all ages.
All family-friendly animated films are rated General Audience.
All movies in the Frozen series are family-friendly animated films.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale” is a film.
“Hachi: A dog’s Tale”  is either a family-friendly animated film or is appropriate for people of all ages. 

Conclusion:
"Hachi: A dog's Tale" either contains excessive erotic and violent content and is a film in the "Frozen" series, or it neither contains excessive erotic and violent content nor is a film in the "Frozen" series.

Is the conclusion True, False, or Uncertain?


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers. Problem: It's a logical entailment problem with categorical statements, universal and existential quantifiers, and a conclusion that is a disjunction. We need to determine if conclusion is true, false, or uncertain. This is a typical entailment checking problem. VAMPIRE is best for entailment. Clingo is for combinatorial search, but could encode as ASP but not needed. Z3 is for constraint satisfaction with numeric bounds, not needed. So ranking: VAMPIRE > CLINGO > Z3. Provide JSON.
