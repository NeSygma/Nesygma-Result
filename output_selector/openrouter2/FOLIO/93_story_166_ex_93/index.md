 SELECTOR META EVALUATOR AGENT

 Query: Premises:
Pets are allowed in some managed buildings.
A deposit is required to rent an apartment in a managed building.
The security deposit can be either equal to the monthly rent at a managed building or more.
Fluffy is Tom's cat.
Cats are pets.
The Olive Garden is a managed building.
The monthly rent at the Olive Garden is $2000.
$2000 is more than $1500.
Tom will rent an apartment in a managed building if he is allowed to move in with Fluffy, and the security deposit is no more than $1500.
If a managed building allows pets, then people are allowed to move in with a pet. 

Conclusion:
Tom will rent an apartment in The Olive Garden.

Is the conclusion True, False, or Uncertain?


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers. Problem: entailment checking from premises to conclusion. It's a natural-language reasoning with quantifiers, predicates, etc. No numeric counting or combinatorial search. So VAMPIRE is best. CLINGO not needed. Z3 not needed. So ranking: VAMPIRE, CLINGO, Z3.


{
    "solver_ranking": ["VAMPIRE", "CLINGO", "Z3"]
