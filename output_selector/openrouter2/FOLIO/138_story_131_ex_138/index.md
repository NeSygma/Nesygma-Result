 Query: Premises:
Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Unsupervised learning algorithms do not require labeled data.
The state-of-the-art text summarization model is trained with machine learning algorithms.
Reinforcement learning is not used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.
The Machine Learning algorithm for training text summarization models requires labeled data.

Conclusion:
Supervised learning is used to train the state-of-the-art text summarization model.

Is the conclusion True, False, or Uncertain?


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers: VAMPIRE, CLINGO, Z3. The problem: It's a logical entailment problem: premises about categories and usage. We need to determine if conclusion follows. This is a typical entailment checking with categorical statements, universal/existential quantifiers. VAMPIRE is best for entailment checking. CLINGO is for combinatorial search, not needed. Z3 is for constraint satisfaction with numeric bounds, not needed. So ranking: VAMPIRE > CLINGO > Z3. Provide JSON.
