 Query: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.Q: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first? Answer Choices: (A)the sci-fi film, the horror film (B)the sci-fi film, the mystery (C)the sci-fi film, the western (D)the western, the horror film (E)the western, the mystery
A: Among A through E, the answer is


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers. Problem: It's a logic puzzle with scheduling constraints, discrete positions (screens, times). We need to determine which list cannot be accurate. This is a combinatorial search with constraints. We need to find which option cannot be scheduled. This is a typical logic puzzle that can be solved by enumeration or constraint satisfaction. The solver type: CLINGO (ASP) is good for combinatorial search with discrete domains. Z3 can also handle constraints, but it's more for numeric constraints, but can handle combinatorial. VAMPIRE is for first-order logic entailment, not suitable. So ranking: CLINGO > Z3 > VAMPIRE. Provide JSON.
