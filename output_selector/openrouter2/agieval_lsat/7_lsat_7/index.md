### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers. Problem: combinatorial selection with constraints. It's a typical logic puzzle with counting constraints. We need to find which option could be selection. This is a constraint satisfaction problem with numeric bounds. We need to test each option against constraints. This is best suited for Z3 (SMT) or CLINGO. VAMPIRE is for entailment, not counting. So ranking: Z3 > CLINGO > VAMPIRE. Provide JSON.
