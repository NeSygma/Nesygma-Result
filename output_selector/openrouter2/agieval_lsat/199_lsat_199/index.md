 Query: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.Q: Which one of the following CANNOT be the antique auctioned on the day immediately preceding the day on which the vase is auctioned? Answer Choices: (A)the harmonica (B)the lamp (C)the mirror (D)the sundial (E)the table
A: Among A through E, the answer is


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers. Problem: It's a scheduling/ordering puzzle with constraints. We need to determine which item cannot be immediately before vase. This is a combinatorial search with ordering constraints. We need to find all possible permutations satisfying constraints and check adjacency. This is a typical logic puzzle. Which solver best? CLINGO is good for combinatorial search with ordering constraints. Z3 also can handle ordering constraints with integer positions. VAMPIRE is for first-order logic entailment, not suitable. So ranking: CLINGO > Z3 > VAMPIRE. Provide JSON.
