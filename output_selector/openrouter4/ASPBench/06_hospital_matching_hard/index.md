Hospitals h18, h19, h20: no acceptable residents (remain empty)

## Constraints

1. Each **resident** must be matched to at most one hospital
2. Each **hospital** must be matched to at most its capacity of residents
3. Only **mutually acceptable** pairs can be matched (both must appear in each other's preference list)
4. **Stability**: No blocking pair (r, h) where:
   - r prefers h over their current assignment (or is unmatched), AND
   - h would accept r (either has free capacity OR prefers r over at least one current assignee)

## Objective

Find all stable matchings that satisfy the constraints.

## Expected Result

This instance has exactly 81 stable matchings. The problem decomposes into independent blocks:
- Blocks A1, A2, A3, A4 each have 3 stable matchings
- Blocks B1, B2, B3 each have 1 unique stable matching
- Total: 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 81 stable matchings

**Fields:**
- **stable_matchings**: List of all stable matchings, where each matching is a list of [resident, hospital] pairs
- **count**: Total number of stable matchings found


### Thinking

- We are given a problem: "Find all stable matchings between 40 residents and 20 hospitals..." with capacities and strict preferences. The problem asks to enumerate all stable matchings. The instance has 81 stable matchings according to the description.
- We need to select the most appropriate solver among VAMPIRE, CLINGO, and Z3. Let's analyze the problem type.
- This is a combinatorial search problem: we have discrete entities (residents and hospitals) with capacities and preferences, and we need to find all matchings that satisfy stability constraints. This is a classic stable matching problem, but with many-to-one matching (hospitals have capacities). This is a constrained satisfaction problem over a finite domain. The answer format is a list of matchings, i.e., constructed configurations.
- VAMPIRE is for first-order logic entailment (True/False/Uncertain) and is not designed for enumerating configurations. It could in principle be used to check if a particular matching is stable, but not to enumerate all stable matchings efficiently.
- CLINGO (Answer Set Programming) excels at combinatorial search and enumeration of all valid states under closed-world assumption. It can handle preferences and stability constraints via rules and integrity constraints. It is well-suited for generating all stable matchings.
- Z3 (SMT solver) can also handle constraint satisfaction over finite domains, and can enumerate solutions using symbolic variables. However, Z3 is more oriented towards verifying satisfaction and finding one model; enumeration can be done but may be less natural than Clingo's generate-and-test. For problems involving preferences and stability, Clingo's logic programming paradigm is often more intuitive and efficient.
- Given that the problem is to find all stable matchings, and the instance is relatively large (40 residents, 20 hospitals) but with a structured decomposition that yields exactly 81 matchings, Clingo is the most appropriate. It can handle the combinatorial search effectively.
- Z3 could also work, but would require encoding the problem as constraints with integer variables and then using iterative model finding to enumerate all solutions, which is possible but might be less efficient. However, Z3 is strong for problems with numeric constraints and ordering, but this problem is purely combinatorial with preferences.
- VAMPIRE is not suitable for enumeration; it is a theorem prover for first-order logic.
- Thus, ranking: CLINGO (most suitable), Z3 (second), VAMPIRE (least).
