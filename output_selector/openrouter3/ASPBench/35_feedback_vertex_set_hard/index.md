 Query: # Problem Statement

Find a minimum-cost set of vertices whose removal makes a directed graph acyclic, subject to constraints on vertex protection, group restrictions, and conditional edges.

## Instance Data

**Graph Structure:**
- Vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}
- Protected vertices (cannot be removed): {1, 15}

**Vertex Costs (removal cost):**
- v1: 10 (protected), v2: 4, v3: 5, v4: 6
- v5: 7, v6: 9, v7: 8
- v8: 2, v9: 4, v10: 3
- v11: 5, v12: 7, v13: 6
- v14: 6, v15: 12 (protected)

**Vertex Groups (at most one vertex from each group can be removed):**
- Group A: {2, 3, 4}
- Group B: {5, 6, 7}
- Group C: {8, 9, 10}
- Group D: {11, 12, 13}
- Group E: {14}

**Core Edges (always present):**
- 1→2, 1→5, 1→8
- 2→3, 3→4, 4→2 (cycle in group A)
- 5→6, 6→7, 7→5 (cycle in group B)
- 8→9, 9→10, 10→8 (cycle in group C)
- 11→12, 12→13, 13→11 (cycle in group D)
- 2→11, 4→14, 7→14, 10→15
- 14→1 (creates long cycle through protected vertex 1)

**Conditional Edges (present only if source vertex is NOT removed):**
- If 3 remains: 3→7, 3→11
- If 6 remains: 6→10, 6→13
- If 9 remains: 9→13, 9→14
- If 12 remains: 12→4, 12→7

## Constraints

1. **Acyclicity**: After removal, **no** directed cycles remain in the graph (considering both core and conditional edges)
2. **Protection**: Vertices 1 and 15 **cannot** be removed
3. **Group Constraint**: **At most** one vertex per group can be removed
4. **Conditional Edges**: Edge (u,v) exists in remaining graph **only** if u is not removed

## Objective

Find a minimum-cost feedback vertex set that **minimizes** the total removal cost (sum of vertex costs) while satisfying all constraints.

**Expected minimum cost: 18**

### Field Descriptions

- `costs`: Array of removal costs corresponding to each vertex in feedback_set
- `total_cost`: Sum of all removal costs
- `remaining_vertices`: Array of vertex IDs that remain after removal (sorted)
