 Query: # Problem Statement

Assign radio frequencies to transmitters while respecting band restrictions, managing interference constraints, and minimizing total licensing costs.

## Instance Data

**Transmitters:** t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6, t7, t8, t9, t10

**Frequencies with Bands and Costs:**
- Low band: 101 (cost 10), 102 (cost 12), 103 (cost 15)
- Mid band: 201 (cost 20), 202 (cost 22), 203 (cost 25), 204 (cost 28)
- High band: 301 (cost 40), 302 (cost 45)

**Transmitter Band Restrictions:**
- Low band only: t1, t2
- Mid band only: t3, t4, t5
- High band only: t6
- Low or mid bands: t7, t8
- Mid or high bands: t9, t10

**Interference Pairs:**
(t1, t2), (t1, t7), (t2, t8), (t3, t4), (t3, t9), (t4, t5), (t4, t7), (t5, t8), (t5, t10), (t6, t9), (t6, t10)

## Constraints

1. **Band Restriction:** Each transmitter can only be assigned a frequency from its allowed band(s).

2. **Same-Band Interference:** If two interfering transmitters use frequencies from the **same band**, their frequencies must differ by more than 1 (e.g., 101 and 103 are valid, but 101 and 102 are not).

3. **Cross-Band Interference:** If two interfering transmitters use frequencies from **different bands**, they cannot use the same frequency number (even though frequencies like 201 and 301 exist, conceptually they cannot conflict).

4. **Complete Assignment:** Every transmitter must be assigned exactly one frequency.

## Objective

Find a solution that **minimizes** the total licensing cost (sum of costs of all assigned frequencies).

**Expected minimum cost: 200**

### Field Descriptions

- `assignments`: Array of assignment objects, each containing:
  - `transmitter`: String identifier (e.g., "t1")
  - `frequency`: Integer frequency value (e.g., 101, 201, 301)
- `total_cost`: Integer representing the sum of all assigned frequency costs
