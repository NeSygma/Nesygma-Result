 Query: # Problem Statement

Construct a stable configuration on a 14x14 grid by placing exactly one Block (2x2 square), one Boat (5-cell bilateral pattern), and one Loaf (7-cell pattern) such that the entire grid forms a valid still life in Conway's Game of Life. A still life is stable when every live cell has exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors, and every dead cell does not have exactly 3 live neighbors.

## Instance Data

- **Grid size**: 14x14
- **Required patterns**:
  - **Block**: 4 cells forming a 2x2 square at relative positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)
  - **Boat**: 5 cells at relative positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1)
  - **Loaf**: 7 cells at relative positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2)

## Constraints

1. Place **exactly one** instance of each required pattern (Block, Boat, Loaf).
2. **No overlapping**: Patterns must not share any cells.
3. **Boundary constraints**: All pattern cells must remain within the 14x14 grid.
4. **Global stability**: The entire grid must form a valid Game of Life still life where:
   - Every live cell has exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors
   - Every dead cell does not have exactly 3 live neighbors (to prevent birth)
5. **Pattern integrity**: The solver must encode the exact geometric shapes and reason about spatial relationships.

## Objective

Find any valid solution that satisfies all constraints.

### Field Descriptions

- **grid**: 14x14 array where 1 represents a live cell and 0 represents a dead cell
- **patterns**: Array of pattern placements, each with:
  - **name**: Pattern type ("block", "boat", or "loaf")
  - **bbox**: Bounding box as [min_row, min_col, max_row, max_col] (inclusive bounds)
