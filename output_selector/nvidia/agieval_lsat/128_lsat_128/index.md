 Query: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.Q: Which one of the following is an acceptable schedule of the movies for this evening? Answer Choices: (A)screen 1: romance at 7 P.M., horror film at 9 P.M. screen 2: western at 7 P.M., sci-fi film at 9 P.M. screen 3: mystery at 8 P.M. (B)screen 1: mystery at 7 P.M., romance at 9 P.M. screen 2: horror film at 7 P.M., sci-fi film at 9 P.M. screen 3: western at 8 P.M. (C)screen 1: western at 7 P.M., sci-fi film at 9 P.M. screen 2: mystery at 7 P.M., horror film at 9 P.M. screen 3: romance at 8 P.M. (D)screen 1: romance at 7 P.M., mystery at 9 P.M. screen 2: western at 7 P.M., horror film at 9 P.M. screen 3: sci-fi film at 8 P.M. (E)screen 1: western at 7 P.M., mystery at 9 P.M. screen 2: sci-fi film at 7 P.M., romance at 9 P.M. screen 3: horror film at 8 P.M.

### Thinking

- We need to analyze problem type and structure to rank solvers. It's a scheduling problem with constraints, discrete positions (screens and times). Need to find which schedule is acceptable. This is a combinatorial search with constraints, likely answer is a specific configuration. This matches CLINGO (answer set programming) typical for planning, scheduling, combinatorial search. Also Z3 could handle constraints and check each option, but the question asks which is acceptable schedule; could be answered by testing each option against constraints. However the problem is about finding a valid configuration among options; it's essentially a satisfaction problem. Z3 could evaluate each option quickly. But typical approach: use CSP/CP solver; Clingo is designed for such scheduling with discrete choices and constraints. Vampire is for logical entailment, not suitable. So ranking: most suitable CLINGO, second Z3, least VAMPIRE. Provide JSON.
