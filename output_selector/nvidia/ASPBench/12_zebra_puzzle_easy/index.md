 Query: # Problem Statement

The Zebra Puzzle, also known as Einstein's Riddle, is a classic logic puzzle. Five houses stand in a row, each painted a different color and inhabited by people of different nationalities who prefer different drinks, smoke different cigarettes, and keep different pets. The question is: who owns the zebra?

## Instance Data

There are **5 houses** in a row, numbered 1 to 5 from left to right. Each house has **exactly one** of each of the following attributes:
- **Color**: Red, Green, White, Yellow, Blue
- **Nationality**: Brit, Swede, Dane, Norwegian, German
- **Drink**: Tea, Coffee, Milk, Beer, Water
- **Cigarette**: Pall Mall, Dunhill, Blends, Blue Master, Prince
- **Pet**: Dog, Birds, Cats, Horse, Zebra

## Constraints

1. The Brit lives in the red house
2. The Swede keeps dogs as pets
3. The Dane drinks tea
4. The green house is on the **left** of the white house (directly adjacent)
5. The green house's owner drinks coffee
6. The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds
7. The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill
8. The person living in the **center house** (house 3) drinks milk
9. The Norwegian lives in the **first house** (house 1)
10. The person who smokes Blends lives **next to** the one who keeps cats
11. The person who keeps a horse lives **next to** the person who smokes Dunhill
12. The owner who smokes Blue Master drinks beer
13. The German smokes Prince
14. The Norwegian lives **next to** the blue house
15. The person who smokes Blends has a neighbor who drinks water

## Objective

Find the complete assignment of attributes to houses that satisfies **all** constraints, and determine who owns the zebra.

- **solution**: Array of 5 objects (one per house, ordered 1-5), each containing:
  - **house**: House number (1-5)
  - **color**: Color of the house
  - **nationality**: Nationality of the resident
  - **drink**: Beverage preference
  - **cigarette**: Cigarette brand smoked
  - **pet**: Pet owned
- **zebra_owner**: Nationality of the person who owns the zebra


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers based on problem type. The problem is a classic logic puzzle with discrete attributes per house, relational constraints, some adjacency, some fixed positions, etc. It requires constructing a full assignment of attributes to houses, i.e., a solution configuration. This is a combinatorial search / planning problem. It involves constraints like adjacency, fixed positions, etc. It's not about entailment of a conclusion but about finding a model that satisfies all constraints. It's essentially a constraint satisfaction / CSP problem. The appropriate solver is Clingo (ASP) because it can handle combinatorial search, generate models, and find assignments. Z3 could also handle it via constraints, but the problem is about constructing a full configuration and enumerating all solutions? The question asks to rank solvers from most suitable to least suitable. Likely Clingo is most suitable, then Z3, then VAMPIRE. Because VAMPIRE is for logical entailment, not for constructing models. So ranking: ["CLINGO","Z3","VAMPIRE"].
