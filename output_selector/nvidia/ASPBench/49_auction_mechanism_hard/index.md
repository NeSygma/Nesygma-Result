 Query: # Problem Statement

Implement a combinatorial auction mechanism that determines the winning bid assignments to maximize total revenue, including base bid prices plus conditional synergy bonuses.

## Instance Data

**Bidders:** 4 bidders with budgets and synergy bonuses
- Bidder `a`: budget=150, synergy_bonus=20
- Bidder `b`: budget=200, synergy_bonus=10
- Bidder `c`: budget=180, synergy_bonus=25
- Bidder `d`: budget=100, synergy_bonus=5

**Items:** 8 items across categories
- `item1`, `item2`, `item5`: electronics
- `item3`, `item4`, `item6`: furniture
- `lic_E`: license for electronics
- `lic_F`: license for furniture

**Bids:** 10 combinatorial bids
- Bid 1: bidder=a, items=[item1, item2], price=70
- Bid 2: bidder=a, items=[lic_E], price=40
- Bid 3: bidder=b, items=[item3, item4], price=90
- Bid 4: bidder=b, items=[lic_F], price=50
- Bid 5: bidder=b, items=[item5], price=60
- Bid 6: bidder=c, items=[item1, item5], price=100
- Bid 7: bidder=c, items=[lic_E], price=60
- Bid 8: bidder=c, items=[item3, item6], price=80
- Bid 9: bidder=d, items=[lic_F], price=25
- Bid 10: bidder=d, items=[item4], price=70

**Fairness Limit:** Maximum 3 items per bidder

## Constraints

1. **Item Exclusivity**: Each item can appear in at most one winning bid
2. **Budget Compliance**: Total price of all bids won by a bidder cannot exceed their budget
3. **Synergy Bonus**: If a bidder wins two or more bids, their synergy bonus is added to total revenue
4. **Licensing Requirement**: To win any bid containing items from a category (electronics or furniture), the bidder must also win a separate bid for the corresponding license (`lic_E` for electronics, `lic_F` for furniture)
5. **Fairness Constraint**: No single bidder can be allocated more than 3 items total across all their winning bids

## Objective

Find a solution that **maximizes** the total revenue, calculated as the sum of winning bid prices plus synergy bonuses for bidders who win multiple bids.

**Expected maximum revenue:** 335

### Field Descriptions

- `bidders`: Array of bidder objects with budget and synergy_bonus properties
- `items`: Array of item objects with category classification
- `bids`: Array of all bid objects with id, bidder, items list, and price
- `winning_bids`: Array of winning bid IDs (sorted)
- `total_revenue`: Integer representing total auction revenue (bid prices + synergy bonuses)
- `synergy_bonuses`: Array of objects showing which bidders received bonuses
- `item_allocation`: Object mapping each allocated item to its winning bidder


### Thinking

- We need to rank solvers based on problem type. Problem is combinatorial auction mechanism with constraints, objective maximize revenue. It involves selecting a set of winning bids subject to constraints: item exclusivity, budget, licensing, fairness, synergy bonuses. This is essentially a combinatorial optimization / planning problem with discrete choices, constraints, and objective. It requires enumerating possible allocations, possibly multiple steps, and find optimal solution. It involves counting constraints (max 3 items per bidder), licensing requirement (must win license bid), synergy bonuses (if multiple bids per bidder). This is a planning / combinatorial search problem with constraints and objective. It resembles a planning / scheduling problem with discrete choices, possibly requiring search over combinations. It is not purely logical entailment; it's more like find a configuration maximizing revenue. That aligns with Clingo's strengths: answer set programming can encode constraints, generate models, and optimize via optimization statements (#maximize). It can handle combinatorial search, constraints, and objective. Z3 could also handle but may be less natural for optimization; could encode as SAT with optimization but less straightforward. Vampire is for logical entailment, not for optimization or combinatorial search. So ranking: most suitable is Clingo, second maybe Z3 (could handle but less natural), least suitable is Vampire.
